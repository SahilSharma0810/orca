/**
 * What became of a prompt an agent's launch command carried, on a host that can see the agent.
 *
 * The prompt is on the agent's command line, so the agent has it once it runs: the launched agent
 * itself (named on its command line, never any other process: a slow shell startup runs its own)
 * still in front a moment after it was first seen, or the agent's own hook turn, is the answer. The
 * pane's shell reporting the launch line finished, or coming back after the agent was seen, is an
 * exit at startup. With neither within the budget, the prompt stays handed to the terminal, as on a
 * host that cannot see: a slow read never costs the caller its follow-up.
